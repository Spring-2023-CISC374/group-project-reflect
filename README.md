Reflect:

Reflect is a 2D platformer who's goal is to teach the basics of college-level concepts to younger audiences! In particular, the game is meant to teach the basic ideas of parallelism.

Jump around, hit switches, step on buttons, and beat levels while thinking of multiple characters moving simultaneously!

The Reflect Team are:

Ryan Dalke: 
Level Transitions, level resets and endings, interactables

Ben Newlin:
Lead level designer, platforming physics programming

Boyuan Yang:
Color, level transitions, level related
